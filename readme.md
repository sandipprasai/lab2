To build two different machine learning models for the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, we will:

Load and preprocess the data
Build and train two different models
Evaluate the models
We'll use two different machine learning algorithms:

Model 1: Logistic Regression
Model 2: Random Forest
Let's start by writing the Python code for these steps. The dataset appears to be in the files wdbc.data and wdbc.names.


This script:

Loads and preprocesses the dataset.
Splits the dataset into training and test sets.
Standardizes the features.
Trains and evaluates a Logistic Regression model.
Trains and evaluates a Random Forest model.
Next steps include capturing screenshots of the various stages and pushing the models to GitHub, as outlined in the Lab instructions.
